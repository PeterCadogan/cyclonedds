.. _`test_your_installation`:

Test your installation
======================

To test if your installation and configuration are working correctly, either:

- Use the |var-project-short| :ref:`dsperf_tool`
   The ``ddsperf`` tool sends a continuous stream of data at a variable frequency. This is useful for sanity checks and to bypass other sporadic network issues.
- Use the :ref:`hello_world` example.
   The **Hello World!** example sends a single message.
